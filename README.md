# libft

One of the introductory projects at [Codam](https://www.codam.nl/en), libft is a static function library, written in C. 
Functions included are either implementations of existing functions from [the standard C library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library) or unique functions that 
standardize common code segments used when coding in C.

This library includes basic functions related to the following sub-domains of C programming:

- String manipulation.
- Linked list structures.
- Memory management.
- Data transformation.
- Reading and writing to external files.

For the complete list of included functions, refer to the libft.h file in the "includes" folder.
The library can be compiled into a libft.a file using the Makefile, located in the root folder.
